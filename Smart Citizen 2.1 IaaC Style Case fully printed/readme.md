## Smart Citizen 2.1 IaaC Style Case fully printed

Here goes my interpretation (v1) of the enclosure, hacking the original one (thanks, Oscar, for the files!). 
Thought I’d give it some IaaC feeling :slightly_smiling_face:
Photos attached.
Still might need some improvement.
By the way, for keeping the housing relatively small, I have used a USB cable with an angled micro USB plug.
