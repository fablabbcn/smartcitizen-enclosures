# Water enclosures

The enclosures in this folder are meant to be used with water probes. The design is normally made out of two main components:

- an [_electronics box_](Electronics/) which contains at least the _SC Data Board_ and some additional electronics for power and probe interface and
- a [_probe holder_](Probe Holders/), which literally, holds the sensor probes (i.e. a single pH sensor probe, or multple other probes of various kinds).

Both are connected via variable length cables (3m, 7.5m, 15m...).

There are various versions of these enclosures and probe holders, some of them more refined than others. Typically, we can classify them in two groups: [Smart Citizen Water Kit](Electronics/SmartCitizen%20Water%20Kit/) for one probe, and [Smart Citizen Water Station](Electronics/SmartCitizen%20Water%20Station/). Make sure to check each folder to see what you are getting, BOM and more components.
