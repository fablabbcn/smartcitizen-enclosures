## Smart Citizen 2.1 IaaC Style Case fully printed

Here goes my interpretation (v1) of the enclosure, hacking the original one (thanks, Oscar, for the files!). 
Thought Iâ€™d give it some IaaC feeling :slightly_smiling_face:
Photos attached.
Still might need some improvement.
By the way, for keeping the housing relatively small, I have used a USB cable with an angled micro USB plug.
