# Smart Citizen Enclosures description - CoKLIMAx project

The following folder includes the 3D print files for the enclosures developed for the Smart Citizen Kit Sensor Hardware and Stations (Versions 1.5, 2.0 and 2.1) families, designed for 3D printing and another rapid prototyping method. See also Smart Citizen Cases reference below.

The development of the enclosure was done by the Institute of Engineering Geodesy (IIGS) https://www.iigs.uni-stuttgart.de/, supported by the Institute of Navigation (INS) https://www.ins.uni-stuttgart.de/ at the University of Stuttgart as part of the CoKLIMAx project, which is funded under the funding guideline "Development and Implementation Preparation of Copernicus Services for Public Needs on Climate Adaptation Strategies for Municipal Applications in Germany" of the German Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport (BMDV).
