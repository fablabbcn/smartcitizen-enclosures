Check the BOM to see the components needed.

## Enclousure 

An [ABS IP65 Wall Box](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/wall-boxes/7696125/?sra=pstk) is used for these unit. For mounting the components  you will need to drill the metal base of the IP65 Wall Box. Use the [*.dxf*](/SmartCitizen Connectivity Unit/base-template.dxf) file as a template using a 5mm drill and a 6mm drill.
