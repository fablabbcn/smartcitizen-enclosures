This Enclosure is build inside a comercial polycarbonate [IP box](https://es.rs-online.com/web/p/cajas-de-uso-general/4985129) the enclosure is weatherproof, but due to the cable glands, we recomend to put this box in to a bigger one to avoid having problems with rain. This box can't be submerged.

The box needs some to be modifed for use, holes are needed for power and data cables. 16mm holes have to be done, to do this holes we use a [step drill bit](https://sg.rs-online.com/web/p/specialist-drill-bits/1238509). In the images below you can see where to do this holes (3 in total).

## Components

There are 3D printed components and laser cut acrylic ones.

### 3D Printed

The prints are done with PLA but you can use other materials like ASA, PETG or ABS, however we don't think it's necessary. Everything is printed with normal 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layer height. We recomend to print with 3 perimeters to increasse strength. You can see the 3D printed base below:

#### CLIP

The SCK is hold in place with the Clip, this one has two slots which fit in the [battery holder](#battery-holder).

#### Battery holder

The battery holder is a small box where the battery can be stored. The battery holder and the clip are put together with the top acrylic in between. The cable of the battery can pas trough a hole in the acrylic and be connected to the SCK.

#### Carriers holder

This piece holds in place the carrier boards. Make sure the boards are in place pressing until the plate "clicks in" and stays in the correct position.

#### Clamp

This piece acts as a spring to hols the acrylic on position.

### Columns top acrylic

Two more Columns are needed to hols the acrylic that holds the SCK and the battery.

### Laser cutted acrylics

Everything is mounted onto two diferent laser cut 4mm acrylic sheets. To assemble the unit, you can put everything together outside the box, mounting the 3D printed parts onto the acrylics and then attaching everything to the Fibox Box.
