# Probe holders

The probe holders in this folder are meant to do just that: hold in place water/soil sensor probes of various kinds. We typically use [Atlas Scientific](https://atlas-scientific.com/) probes, but other such as [DF-robot](https://www.dfrobot.com/search-water%20sensor.html) have similar shapes and could be adapted.

We normally use ABS or PVC plumbing pipes with some custom _3D printed_ parts in ASA or ABS. Then, we use some [316 stainless steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_grade_stainless) nuts and screws to keep everything together. Check each folder in case you are looking for a [single](single/) or [multiple](multiple/) probes.
