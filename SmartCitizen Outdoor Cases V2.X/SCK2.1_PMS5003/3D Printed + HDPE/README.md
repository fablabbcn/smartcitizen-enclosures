This enclosure is a mixed solution with 3D printed components and commercial parts (PMMA-Acrylic pipe). The top lid can be either milled or printed.

## Printing settings

We have tested the 3D printed components with both PLA or ABS. Good results are achieved with a normal 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2 layer height. No raft or brim are needed.

### Clip

The SCK and the PMS5003 are held together by a 3D printed clip. No support is needed for this part. 

### Base

Support is needed for this part and two versions are provided (with and without support in the STL file).

### Locks

Flexible locks are also provided for better fixation. No support is needed. 

### Cable gland

A small cable gland is also design to help improve waterproofness and fix the USB cable. It can be stored in the _pocket_ next to the opening.
