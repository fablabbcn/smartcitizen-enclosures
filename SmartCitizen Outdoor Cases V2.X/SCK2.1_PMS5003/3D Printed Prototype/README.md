This enclosure is a fully 3D printed solution. This case is a prototype, feel free to modify it!

We have tested the 3D printed components with both PLA or ABS. Good results are achieved with a normal 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2 layer height. No raft or brim are needed.

### Clip

The SCK and the PMS5003 are held together by a 3D printed clip. No support is needed for this part. 

### Base-Top

Support is not needed for this part. A gasket can be added to the joint with adhesive foam. You can increase the top's thickness if you need better isolation, or use the foam provided with the SCK's box as an insulator. Also, tin foil is quite a good reflective material and helps with sun radiation.

### Locks

Flexible locks are also provided for better fixation. No support is needed. 

### Cable gland

A small cable gland is also design to help improve waterproofness and fix the USB cable. It can be stored in the _pocket_ next to the opening.

### Enlarged Cover

If you want to have some more space in the cover (eg to put a Solar MPPT and an additional battery in it), you can use the File COVER25.STL. This cover gives you an additional height of 2,5cm.
